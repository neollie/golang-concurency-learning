## examples/patters
Directory examples/patters shows various examples following tutorial [Go Concurrency Patterns ][gcp_slides]. My examples can differ from lecture one but follow lecture flow. Each example has test run function, that doesn't check anything but can be run to see output. Structure doesn't follow Go advices, TBD later.

[Go Concurrency Patterns ][gcp_slides]  ([video][gcp_video]) presents the basics of Go's concurrency primitives and several ways to apply them.

### Run example : 
```
#cd src/github.com/neollie/examples/patterns/Ex1/
#go test -v nopatter_test.go
```

## other examples
Examples from Go Tour or own trials
